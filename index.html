    <h2 class = "section-title">ABOUT</h2>
    <p>My name is Denis Kent. I have an academic background in Molecular Biochemistry and professional experience in consulting.
      Currently I work as data analyst and strategy consultant advising on small-medium sized company acquisitions.
      Over the past years I have become interested in coding, largely due to the enjoyment of solving logical problems.</p>

    <p>Having learnt Python and Visual basic in my spare evenings, I have tried to incorporate coding into my role,
      but there have been few opportunities to do so. In order to further my learning I began work on passion projects
      (see <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a>). These developed my language capabilities (Python, VBA, C++),
      helped me to understand the complexities of developing larger applications and introduced me to basic practicalities of database management and APIâ€™s.</p>

    <p>Following this passion will require a transition in to the tech industry.
      The Founders and Coders bootcamp is ideally structured to provide this.
      Focusing purely on improving skills through pair programming and regular team
      workshops helps students learn rapidly while also enabling them to experience larger, more
      complex projects. Founders and Coders recruiting partner relationships also provide opportunities to enter the workforce quickly.</p>

    <p>Having met some of the current students, I was pleasantly surprised how patient and
      helpful they were, spending their evenings helping people during workshops.
      This highlighted to me the environment that students were studying in and the values they have,
      which I share. I am also attracted by the accessibility of the course. I think it is admirable
      that it enables people to follow their passion in coding irrespective of their background.
      The mentoring system in place and the pro bono work done for local businesses/non-profits creates a culture of giving back.</p>

    <p>Thank you for considering me.</p>
